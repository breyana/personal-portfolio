          In my college years I attended a program called Year Up that was a year
          long internship program that trained me how to work in the tech industry.
          From there, I was able to intern at Zynga and was offered a contract position.
          This is where I catapulted into the tech industry.

          More recently I began attending Learners Guild in order to have space to learn how to code.
          I was one of the first of my cohort to reach Level 3.

          I love playing tabletop games (worker placement and deck building), cat sitting, and going to rock shows.
