          I'm a SF Bay Area Native that enjoys board gaming and adventuring.
          In my college years I attended a program called Year Up that was a year
          long internship program that trained me how to work in the tech industry.
          From there, I was able to intern at Zynga and was offered a contract position.
          This is where I catapulted into the tech industry.
